<h1>Welcome to the official website for Sencha stakepool!</h1>

<p>Things are still under construction, check back here in a week or so for updates and improvements to this website.</p>
</br>
<p>We appreciate stake from anyone, but starting out, those who stake more than 500,000 ADA to our pool will receive a free bag of high quality organic Japanese tea each month. If more than 500,000 ADA is staked then each 250,000 over the initial 500k ADA will earn an extra bag (ex. 750k ADA = 2 bags)</p>
</br>
<p>Each month the type of tea could be one of Gyokuro, Sencha, Bancha, Houjicha, Kamairicha, Fukamushi, or Kabusecha, all organic and imported from Japan!</p>
</br>
<p>Each bag will be between 50g and 100g depending on the type and quality of the tea. Gyokuro is higher in quality and more expensive than Bancha so Gyrokuro comes in a 50g bag vs Bancha which is 100g.</p>
</br>
<p>Tea will be shipped out once a month at the end of the month. Every staker with more than 500,000 stake, who has verified their stake, sent us their mailing address, and has been staked to SNCHA stakepool for more than 30 days will be eligible.</p>
</br>
<p>We will ship worldwide but your mailing address must also be in one of the countries on this list: <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immctry.htm">https://pe.usps.com/text/imm/immctry.htm</a></p>
</br>
<p>Starting out, each month we will randomly select 1 verified staker with over 5,000 ADA staked to receive a package of tea. This number will increase gradually up to 5 as the pool grows to give those with less opportunity a chance to win some tea as well!</p>
</br>
<p>
If you have staked enough to be eligible please follow these steps to be verified:
<ul>
	<li>Send 1 ADA to this address: addr1q962806dr4k0yu2n2pvherrrh57f8pcnt3yjpp8cmyvny8jt2asp7kxlttwwdcz8ep92sa8ggl5sz20tl56kahc76ems6f2mes</li>
	<li>Send an email to <em>operator@sencha-stakepool.com</em> containing:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Your mailing address</li>
		<li>Your public address from which the 1 ADA was sent</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
</p>

</br>
<p>We will use your public address to derive your stake address and verify that your are staking to our pool. Your mailing address or public key will never be shared with anyone else and will be deleted upon request.</p>
